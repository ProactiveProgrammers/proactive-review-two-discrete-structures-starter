# Proactive Review

TODO: Answer all of the following questions in the specified fashion. Please
note that, in addition to ensuring that your GitHub repository has a passing
build, the course instructor will also confirm that you have adequately answered
all of the questions by providing meaningful responses to each of them.

## Technical Review

### Record three Python functions from the following sources that you can correctly write on your own without assistance

You can review the following materials for examples of Python functions:

- course textbooks
- course web site
- course slides
- any course projects, including:
    - source code surveys
    - programming projects
    - engineering efforts

TODO: You must use a fenced code block to record these Python functions
TODO: The fenced code block must designate that it contains Python source code
TODO: Please do not pick the same fenced code blocks that you did for the last review
TODO: The fenced code blocks that you provide should be from content covered during this module

#### Provide the first Python function that you can write on your own without assistance

#### Provide the second Python function that you can write on your own without assistance

#### Provide the third Python function that you can write on your own without assistance

### Using a previously provided function, provide Python code to show how to call it

TODO: You must use a fenced code block to provide the example of a call to a Python function

### Using a previously provided function, modify it to illustrate a defect and then explain why it is wrong

TODO: You must use a fenced code block to provide the example of a defect in a Python function
TODO: You must provide at least one paragraph to explain why the source code is defective
TODO: Your response should explain a mental model that would lead to a programmer making this mistake

### Using the defective function, provide a function call example that would show it is wrong

TODO: You must use a fenced code block to provide a call to the defective Python function
TODO: You may express this function call example through either a "main function" or a test case

## Learning Objectives

TODO: Review the learning objectives at [Learning Objectives for Discrete
structures](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/discrete-structures/learning-objectives-discrete-structures/)
and then use the following instructions to complete the next questions.

TODO: The learning objectives that you state and discuss should be different than the ones
that you explained during the completion of the last proactive review assignment

### Record three learning objectives for which you judge you can demonstrate mastery of the technical skill

#### Restate the first learning objective and then explain how you know that you have mastered it

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain why you have mastered the technical skill

#### Restate the second learning objective and then explain how you know that you have mastered it

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain why you have mastered the technical skill

#### Restate the third learning objective and then explain how you know that you have mastered it

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain why you have mastered the technical skill

### Give a learning objective that you have improved on since the last module of the course

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain what you did to improve your knowledge
TODO: When you are writing your response to this question, please follow this template:



### Give a learning objective that connects to covered material but for which you must continue to work

TODO: Retype the learning objective and the explain what work you need to
complete so as to ensure that you can develop a mastery of the stated technical skill

## Review Checklist

TODO: If you have questions or concerns about content in this module that you
could not resolve after completing the proactive review, please take these steps:

- [] Posted questions to a public channel in Discord for any unresolved issues
